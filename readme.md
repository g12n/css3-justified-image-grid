## CSS3 Justified Image Grid

Justifies Image Grids are great to show galleries. They were adopted by [flickr][link-flickr] and [Google+][link-google] for their publich albums and photo stream. 

I was inspired by [this article by Florian Maul][link-googleInspired] and [by CollagePlus, a wonderful jQuery implementation][link-collageplus]  of the algotrythm by [Ed Lea][link-ed]. Current Implementations of this layout involve Javascript and can be quite Taxing on the client site.

This is a CSS-Only version of this layout, based entirely on CSS3-Flexbox.
